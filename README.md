# Chatbot-for-Customer-Service


## Introduction

----------

This project showcases a chatbot built using PyTorch and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user input in a conversational manner.

## Getting Started

----------

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Run  `pip install -r requirements.txt`  within the chatbot folder to install all dependencies. This will ensure that you have all the necessary libraries and tools to run the project.
2.  **Create Virtual Environment**: Create a virtual environment in Python to isolate the project's dependencies. This will help prevent conflicts with other projects and ensure that the project runs smoothly.
3.  **Start the Project**: Activate the virtual environment and navigate to the chatbot folder.

## Training and Running the Chatbot

----------

### Training the Model

To train the model, run  `python train.py`. This will use the PyTorch library to train a neural network model on a dataset of conversations. The model will learn to recognize patterns in language and respond accordingly.

### Starting the Chat

Once the model is trained, you can start chatting with the bot by running  `python chat.py`. This will launch a simple text-based interface where you can interact with the chatbot.

## Screenshots
